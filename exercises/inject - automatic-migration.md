# Modern Angular - inject automatic migration

In this exercise we will make use of Angular schematic to migrate our application to the new `inject` function in order to get rid of the constructor based dependency injection.

## Migrate to inject
In order to migrate to the new `inject` function, we need to use the `ng generate` command.

```bash
npx ng g @angular/core:inject 
```

You should see the following output:

```
? Which path in your project should be migrated? ./src/
? Do you want to migrate abstract classes? Abstract classes are not migrated by default, because their parameters aren't guaranteed to be injectable yes
? Do you want to clean up all constructors or keep them backwards compatible? Enabling this option will include an additional signature of `constructor(...args: unknown[]);` that will avoid errors for sub-classes, but will increase the amount of generated code by the migration no
? Do you want optional inject calls to be non-nullable? Enable this option if you want the return type to be identical to @Optional(), at the expense of worse type safety yes
```

> [!NOTE]
> Pass the application root ./src/ as path to migrate the whole app.
> Reject prompt to keep constructors backwards compatible
> Agree to migrate abstract classes as well when asked.
> Agree to clean up all constructors when asked.

After the migration is complete, inspect the changes in your git diff.
You should see that all your constructors are now replaced with the `inject` function ðŸŽ‰.
